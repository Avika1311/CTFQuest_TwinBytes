# CTFQuest_TwinBytes
Write-ups for challenges solved by Team Twinbytes during CTFQuest.


This repository contains detailed write-ups of challenges solved by Team Twinbytes during the CTFQuest Capture The Flag competition.

CTFQuest challenged participants across a wide range of cybersecurity domains, testing both technical depth and problem-solving skills. As a team, we focused not only on solving the challenges but also on understanding the underlying concepts, vulnerabilities, and attack methodologies involved.

Each write-up in this repository documents our approach in a clear and structured manner, outlining the observations made, reasoning followed, and steps taken to reach the final solution. The goal of these write-ups is to reflect our learning process and provide a concise yet comprehensive explanation of how each challenge was approached and solved during the competition.
